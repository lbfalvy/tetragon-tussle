# Tetragon Tussle

A couch multiplayer game inspired by Square Brawl, but hopefully with fewer bugs, attempting to capture the spirit of Fireboy & Watergirl and other iconic local multiplayer flash games.

## Tech stack

Just typescript really, the game draws graphics directly with JS to a HTML5 canvas. React is there to make menu building quicker and isn't referenced in any game logic.

## To-Do, in no particular order

- scoring, gamemodes, game over screen
- HP, HP indicator
- more maps & a map selector
- more weapons & a concurrent weapon selector
- secondary weapon support
- controller input

## I would like to have these

- online multiplayer through authoritative server
- enemy AI, player teams
- fancy effects (Square Brawl uses Unity physics but we can do other things)
